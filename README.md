**Figure 1. Who Run the World.** The source of data is Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results 2019 (Chirico, 2019), which includes survey results from 88,863 developers using Stack Overflow in 2019.

**Figure a. The Salary Gap between Genders in Different Countries (On the top).** To focus more on the difference between countries, we take out the top 100 countries with the highest number of respondents (men and women combined). We define the "salary gap" between genders by calculating the subtraction between the average yearly salary of men and women in different countries, then divide the subtraction by average yearly women's salary of that country. In the choropleth maps, "salary gap" is represented by different shades of blue. The darker the blue is, the greater the "salary gap".

**Figure b. Male and Female Developers’ Highest Education Level (Bottom left).** We divided the education into 6 levels, Bachelor, Master, College/University, Secondary school, Doctoral and Other degrees. Others include Associate degree, Primary/Elementary school, Professional degree and people who never completed any formal education. Each figure’s different colors in the donut chart represent different education levels. And the area of the same color means the ratio of developers who are in the same education level.

**Figure c. Gender Satisfaction Disparity (Bottom middle).** We select those countries with significant differences in salary between male and female and calculate the percentage of developers satisfied with their jobs. We then plot the satisfaction(x-axis) of female(red) and male(blue) respectively in different countries(y-axis).

**Figure d. Male and Female Developers’ Preferable Programming Language (Bottom right).** Differences in the percentage of the use of various kinds of programming languages between men and women who work as full-time developers. The result directly indicated the difference in the choice of programming languages between men and women. In the bar chart, programming languages are sorted in the order of language usage from the most to the least. If the difference is positive, the bar will be colored into blue, representing that they are more popular in male developer. If the difference is negative, the bar will be colored into red, representing that they are more popular in female developer.

### Significance
This research project displays the current world landscape of gender disparity as software developers. Inspired by the prevalence of Women Empowerment movement throughout 21st century, we explore the existence and the reason behind salary gap in the field of software developing. By analyzing the response from more than 88,000 developers using Stack Overflow all across the world in 2019, we demonstrate that there are still significant salary gaps existing between men and women across all different countries. We also find that female developers have higher overall education level than men developers and prefer programming languages associated more with front-end development.

### Findings
*1. Female developers have higher overall education level than men developers.* In terms of higher education, female developers have 5.2% more bachelor’s degree (50.2% to 45%) and 1.3% more master’s degree (24% to 22.7%) than males. On the other hand, male developers who have a lower education level than bachelor are 7% more than female developers.

*2. Female developers tend to prefer programming languages associated with front-end development.* Across 14 programming languages, all of them that have a higher (<9%) percentage in female developers (the red bars) are related to front-end development. Meanwhile, in other programming fields (the 10 blue bars), the percentage of male
developers’ preference is larger (all over 2%) than that of females. However, the difference between male and female is not that significant nor conclusive.

*3. With regard to satisfaction, gender disparity is less significant.* In China, India, United Kingdom, and United States, differences in the percentage of satisfaction between males and females are less than 0.3%. Another interesting finding is western countries are of high satisfaction in general. In Europe and North America, female's satisfaction is higher (>70%). While fewer developers in Asian countries are satisfied with their jobs (<60%), among which male are more satisfied than female.

### Data
*Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results 2019 (Stack Overflow Survey).* Stack Overflow Survey is the largest and most comprehensive survey of people who code around the world. It is freely available at https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-2019. The version used in this study includes nearly 90,000 responses covering everything from developers’ favorite technologies to their job preferences.

### Method
1. Figure b reflects the difference in ratio of highest education level. At the beginning, we sum up the total numbers of each education level. But we found that the responses from male developers are a lot more than that of female developers. Therefore, we decided to calculate the ratio of each education level to get a more comparable result between male and female. Based on these results, we draw 2 donut charts to represent the ratio of each gender’s education level.

2. Figure c reflects the difference of preferable choice of programming languages between different genders of full-time, professional developers. Firstly, to achieve our goal, we sum up the numbers of each programming language choice respectively for men and women. Considering the fact that the number of male respondents is much larger than females in this dataset, it's meaningless to compare the sum totals directly. Therefore, we derive the proportion of each programming language for men and women. After that, we calculate the percentage subtraction between male and female to get a better understanding of the difference of preferable choice in every language field.

3. Figure d reflects the gender disparity of satisfaction in different countries. We reclassify the original five categories of job satisfaction into three: Satisfied (including very satisfied, slightly satisfied), Neutral (including neither satisfied nor dissatisfied), and Dissatisfied (including very dissatisfied, slightly dissatisfied). We further calculate the proportion of satisfied female and male developers in each country as the measurement of satisfaction.

### Discusion
Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in development and economics in the last decade. According to the report of State of the Gender Pay Gap in 2019 (PayScale, 2019) by Salary comparison site PayScale, the difference between the earnings of women and men has shrunk since that have started tracking the gender pay gap from 2010. But it might not be as optimistic as it seems in occupations dominant by male, such as Construction, Installation and Maintenance, Architecture & Engineering, and the one we are in right now, Computer Science.

We evaluated the difference between male and female in the field of software development from different perspectives, including education level, job satisfaction, preferable programming language and of course, salary gap. We believed that the key to the reasons of salary gap could have just lies in one of those aspects. However, much to our surprise, there weren’t much a difference between the choice of programming languages and satisfaction rate. Furthermore, female developers even have an overall higher education levels than most male counterparts, which was supposed to lead to higher salary in most cases.

But WHY? Why would such a substantial salary gap still exist regardless of all these factors? Is it merely a matter of sexual discrimination? One possible answer we propose is that there might be a vicious circle existing within the domain of developers. There has been research showing that technology company often engage in behaviors that are known to create a chilly environment for women (Wynn & Correll, 2018). This kind of behavior lessen the interest of women at the point of recruitment into technology careers, which could result in less women entering the area of technology. All of these leads to discrimination, stereotyping and implicit biases in earnings and promotion opportunities for women, which in return continue to discourage more women from getting into technology.

One could argue that this might not be a problem at all, since it’s a common stereotype that men tend to outperform women in field related to technology. So why would we keep insisting that it’s crucial to diminish the salary gap between male and female software developers? First of all, it’s a matter of right and wrong. Paying women less than men is not only unfair, it also has far-reaching implications for society by contributing to the gender pay gap, women’s lower pension contributions and their higher incidence of relative poverty in later life. Secondly, there has been research suggesting that the general collective intelligence factor that explains a group’s performance on a wide variety of tasks is correlated with the proportion of females in the group (Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone, 2010). In conclusion, it’s not only a requirement for fairness, but also a beneficial factor for the whole technology industry.
